## General info
1. KGDAL obtains two-dimensional attention in both the time and feature spaces for improved prediction power and enhanced model interpretability.
2. The attention mechanism in the feature space is automatically derived based on the KG rather than manual curation. %as a guidance to build the attention mechanism
3. KGDAL can model both continuous and discrete temporal EHR data types.
4. KGDAL can make precise rolling mortality predictions for AKI-D patients on two independent clinical datasets.
